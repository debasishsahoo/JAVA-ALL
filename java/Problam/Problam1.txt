 Add a new package called technology to your exercises directory.

Class design: Create a new class called Computer. Before you add any more code, know that you will need to add two additional classes: Laptop and SmartPhone. Before you start coding anything inside these classes, diagram how the three classes are going to be related to each other. Remember to add properties and methods to your diagram!

For a parent class add 3 properties, 2 methods, and a constructor.

For a child class add at least 1 additional property and 1 additional method.

Class implementation: Implement your design and test it in a Program.java class.
